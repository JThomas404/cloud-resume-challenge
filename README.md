# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

This repository documents my journey through the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge. The challenge involved building and deploying a simple static website that serves as my resume, hosted on AWS.

## Overview

The challenge is divided into multiple steps:

1. **Static Website**: Built a portfolio website using HTML and CSS, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience.
2. **Deploy on AWS**: Hosted the website using AWS S3, configured CloudFront as a CDN, and managed DNS with Route 53.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate deployments whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Managed the infrastructure using Terraform to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For building the static website.
- **AWS S3**: For hosting the static site.
- **AWS CloudFront**: For content delivery network (CDN) to ensure fast loading times.
- **AWS Route 53**: For managing DNS.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipeline.
- **Terraform**: For Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Live Website

The website is deployed and accessible at: [My Cloud Resume Website](http://my-cloud-resume-bucket123.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)
